*****  IMPORTANT  *****
This LITE version of the plugin WILL not work without purchasing the core plugin called 2DLayer Highlighter tool available on the asset store here http://bit.ly/1eppOAb
If you bought the COMPLETE Version - ignore this message! :-)


*****  In case of exceptions.  *****
The core plugin must be imported into your project first. In case of errors, DELETE both your plugin folders and reimport ' 2DLayer Highlighter' first, then import the 2DToolkit highlighter plugin.


*****  SUGGESTIONS  *****
DO NOT use Z increments of less than 0.1 as this will not show properly in the hierarchy tool.


*****  CANNOT WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH NGUI DEPTH HIGHLIGHTER PLUGIN  *****
